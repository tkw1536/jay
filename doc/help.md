# Introduction

Jay provides secret majority votes to any member of Jacobs University. This guide elaborates on defining filters, configuring a vote, and the permissions of different classes of users.

# Filters

Filters are user-defined, arbitrary complexity boolean expressions. Users who satisfy the specified condition can vote.  Jay defines multiple primitive operators that can be applied to compare fields in a user's profile to given constants.

#### Primitives
* Equality: `equals` or `==` or `===`, all equivalent
* Less than: `<`
* Greater than: `>`

#### Logic
* Binary: `AND` `OR` `XOR`
* Unary: `NOT`
* Constants: `true` `false`

#### User profile fields

Any field in the user profile object can be used in a primitive filter expression. A sample user is provided below.
```

}
```

# Votes

#### Staging
Votes have 5 stages that are activated in the following order:

##### Init
Newly created votes are created in this state. All details are editable.

##### Staged
Once votes enter this state, no further edits to any part of it are allowed. If an opening time is set, the vote will open automatically.

##### Open
Any eligible user can vote. If a closing time is specified, the vote will close automatically.

##### Closed
No further voting is allowed. Individual user participation records are discarded. Results are visible to admins of the voting system instance. If a publication time was specified, the results will be published at that time.

##### Public
The last stage of any vote. Results are public.
